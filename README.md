# Airline Passengers Traffic Forecasting using ARIMA Model

### Introduction

In order, to provide cutting-edge solution to optimize operations, enhance planning, and deliver exceptional customer experiences, I had implemented Airline Passengers Traffic Forecasting using a Time Series Model i.e. ARIMA Model to predict the traffic for next 5 years for helping the Travel Agency helps organizations understand the underlying causes of trends or systemic patterns over time.

### ARIMA Model

An autoregressive integrated moving average, or ARIMA, is a statistical analysis model that uses time series data to either better understand the data set or to predict future trends. A statistical model is autoregressive if it predicts future values based on past values.

#### What is ARIMA used for?
It's used in statistics and econometrics to measure events that happen over a period of time.

#### Why ARIMA is used for forecasting?
ARIMA models use differencing to convert a non-stationary time series into a stationary one, and then predict future values from historical data. These models use “auto” correlations and moving averages over residual errors in the data to forecast future values.

### Work Process

I have meticulously performed dataset cleaning and preprocessing using Python, followed by a comprehensive time series analysis utilizing the ARIMA Model. By leveraging this statistical approach, which relies on the autoregressive nature of the data, accurate predictions of future values based on historical data have been achieved.

### Tools Used
Python - Model Building

Hence, Airline Passengers Traffic Forecasting using ARIMA Model successfully implemented for next 5 years.
